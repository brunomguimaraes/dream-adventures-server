4. **Trainer Adjustable Parameters**
   - **Playstyle**: 
     - **Aggressive**: Increases damage dealt and received.
     - **Balanced**: No changes to damage or defense.
     - **Passive**: Decreases damage dealt and received.
   - **Creativity**:
     - **Environment**: Boosts stats based on environmental conditions.
     - **Balanced**: No changes to stats.
     - **Inner Strength**: Boosts core stats like attack and defense.
   - **Tiredness**:
     - **Push Limits**: Increases damage and attack rate but depletes energy faster.
     - **Balanced**: No changes to damage or energy consumption.
     - **Save Energy**: Reduces damage and attack rate but conserves energy.

#### Damage Calculation Formula

The damage calculation in this system incorporates the complexity of multiple stats, status effects, environmental factors, and trainer parameters. The core formula is:

\[ 
\text{Damage} = \left( \text{Base Power} + \text{Attack Stat} - \text{Defense Stat} \right) \times \text{Elemental Multiplier} + \text{Stat Bonus} + \text{Critical Bonus}
\]

- **Stat Bonus**:
\[ 
\text{Stat Bonus} = \left( \text{ENG} + \text{MOR} + \text{AFF} + \text{FOC} + \text{AUR} + \text{INST} + \text{SYN} \right) / 10 
\]

- **Critical Bonus**:
\[ 
\text{Critical Bonus} = \left( \frac{\text{CRIT\_RATE}}{100} \times \text{Base Power} \right) \times \text{Critical Multiplier} 
\]

- **Behavior Adjustments**:
  - Playstyle, Creativity, and Tiredness impact the final damage and energy consumption as follows:
  - **Playstyle**:
    - Aggressive: \( \text{Damage} \times 1.2 \), \( \text{Defense} \times 0.8 \)
    - Passive: \( \text{Damage} \times 0.8 \), \( \text{Defense} \times 1.2 \)
  - **Creativity**:
    - Environment: Boosts specific stats depending on the current environment.
    - Inner Strength: \( \text{Attack} \times 1.1 \), \( \text{Defense} \times 1.1 \)
  - **Tiredness**:
    - Push Limits: \( \text{Damage} \times 1.2 \), Attack Rate \( \times 1.2 \), Energy Consumption \( \times 1.5 \)
    - Save Energy: \( \text{Damage} \times 0.8 \), Attack Rate \( \times 0.8 \), Energy Consumption \( \times 0.5 \)

#### Example Calculation

Assume a monster has the following stats and the move used is a Psychic Attack:
- **ATK**: 80
- **DEF**: 70
- **SP_ATK**: 100
- **SP_DEF**: 90
- **SPD**: 50
- **HP**: 200
- **ENG**: 80
- **MOR**: 10
- **AFF**: 20
- **FOC**: 15
- **AUR**: 5
- **INST**: 10
- **SYN**: 25
- **Elemental Multiplier**: 2 (type advantage)
- **Base Power**: 50
- **Critical Rate**: 5%
- **Critical Multiplier**: 1.5

The trainer sets the parameters:
- **Playstyle**: Aggressive
- **Creativity**: Environment (Rain)
- **Tiredness**: Push Limits

##### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Stat Bonus Calculation**:
\[ 
\text{Stat Bonus} = \left( 80 + 10 + 20 + 15 + 5 + 10 + 25 \right) / 10 
= 165 / 10 
= 16.5 \]
Rounded to the nearest whole number:
\[ 
\text{Stat Bonus} = 17 
\]

2. **Base Damage Calculation**:
\[ 
\text{Base Damage} = \left( 50 + 100 - 90 \right) \times 2 + 17 
= (60) \times 2 + 17 
= 120 + 17 
= 137 
\]

3. **Critical Bonus Calculation**:
\[ 
\text{Critical Bonus} = \left( \frac{5}{100} \times 50 \right) \times 1.5 
= 2.5 \times 1.5 
= 3.75 
\]
Rounded to the nearest whole number:
\[ 
\text{Critical Bonus} = 4 
\]

4. **Total Damage Before Adjustments**:
\[ 
\text{Total Damage} = 137 + 4 
= 141 
\]

5. **Behavior Adjustments**:
   - **Aggressive Playstyle**: 
   \[ \text{Adjusted Damage} = 141 \times 1.2 = 169.2 \]
   - **Creativity (Environment: Rain)**:
     - Speed stat is boosted:
     \[ \text{SPD} = 50 \times 1.1 = 55 \]
   - **Tiredness (Push Limits)**:
     \[ \text{Adjusted Damage} = 169.2 \times 1.2 = 203.04 \]
     \[ \text{Energy Consumption} = 1.5 \]

Final rounded damage:
\[ 
\text{Final Adjusted Damage} = \text{Math.round}(203.04) = 203 
\]

6. **Apply Damage and Energy Consumption**:
   - The opponent monster's HP is reduced by 203.
   - The user's monster's energy is reduced by 1.5 units.

#### Narrative and Reporting System

To create an engaging

 narrative that captures the feel of an anime-style battle, the system generates detailed descriptions of each move, including the effects of status conditions and environmental factors.

##### Battle Description Example

```javascript
function describeMove(user, move, target, damage, critical, environment, actionType) {
    let description = `${user} used ${move}! `;

    if (environment !== ENVIRONMENT.CLEAR) {
        description += `The ${environment} affects the battlefield! `;
    }

    switch(actionType) {
        case ACTIONS.ATTACK:
            description += `${target} took ${damage} damage.`;
            break;
        case ACTIONS.DEFEND:
            description += `${user} braces for impact.`;
            break;
        case ACTIONS.SPECIAL:
            description += `${user} used a special move!`;
            break;
    }

    if (critical) {
        description += " It's a critical hit!";
    }

    return description;
}

function applyStatusEffect(target, statusEffect) {
    let statusDescription = '';

    switch (statusEffect) {
        case STATUS_EFFECTS.BURN:
            statusDescription = `${target} is burned and will take damage over time.`;
            break;
        case STATUS_EFFECTS.FREEZE:
            statusDescription = `${target} is frozen solid!`;
            break;
        case STATUS_EFFECTS.PARALYZE:
            statusDescription = `${target} is paralyzed and may be unable to move.`;
            break;
        case STATUS_EFFECTS.POISON:
            statusDescription = `${target} is poisoned and will take damage over time.`;
            break;
        case STATUS_EFFECTS.SLEEP:
            statusDescription = `${target} fell asleep and cannot move.`;
            break;
        case STATUS_EFFECTS.CONFUSE:
            statusDescription = `${target} is confused and might hurt itself.`;
            break;
        default:
            statusDescription = `${target} is in good condition.`;
    }

    return statusDescription;
}

function updateBattleState(user, target, actionType) {
    switch (actionType) {
        case ACTIONS.ATTACK:
            battleState.momentum = user === playerMonster.name ? 'player' : 'opponent';
            break;
        case ACTIONS.DEFEND:
            battleState.momentum = target === playerMonster.name ? 'opponent' : 'player';
            break;
        case ACTIONS.SPECIAL:
            battleState.momentum = 'neutral';
            break;
    }
}
```

#### Example Battle Turn with Narrative

```javascript
function performBattleAction(userMonster, userMove, targetMonster, actionType, playstyle, creativity, tiredness) {
    let moveDetails = calculateDamage(
        90, // base power of the move
        userMonster.stats.PSY_ATK, // using psychic attack for this example
        targetMonster.stats.PSY_DEF,
        userMonster.stats.ELEM_MULT,
        userMonster.stats.CRIT_RATE,
        userMonster.stats.CRIT_MULT,
        userMonster.stats,
        userMonster.statusEffect,
        playstyle,
        creativity,
        tiredness,
        battleState.environment
    );

    let battleDescription = describeMove(userMonster.name, userMove, targetMonster.name, moveDetails.adjustedDamage, moveDetails.isCriticalHit, battleState.environment, actionType);
    console.log(battleDescription);

    let statusDescription = applyStatusEffect(targetMonster.name, userMonster.statusEffect);
    console.log(statusDescription);

    let remainingHP = applyDamage(targetMonster, moveDetails.adjustedDamage);
    console.log(`${targetMonster.name} has ${remainingHP} HP remaining.`);

    // Adjust attack rate and energy consumption for tiredness behavior
    userMonster.stats.ENG -= moveDetails.energyConsumption;

    updateBattleState(userMonster.name, targetMonster.name, actionType);
}

// Example battle turn with balanced trainer adjustments
performBattleAction(playerMonster, 'Thunderbolt', opponentMonster, ACTIONS.ATTACK, PLAYSTYLE.AGGRESSIVE, CREATIVITY.ENVIRONMENT, TIREDNESS.PUSH_LIMITS);
nextTurn();
performBattleAction(opponentMonster, 'Flamethrower', playerMonster, ACTIONS.ATTACK, PLAYSTYLE.PASSIVE, CREATIVITY.INNER_STRENGTH, TIREDNESS.SAVE_ENERGY);
nextTurn();
```
